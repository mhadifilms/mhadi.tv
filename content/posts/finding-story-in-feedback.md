Client feedback can feel like chaos. Three different voices, each pointing in different directions. Notes that seem to contradict each other. Requests that feel impossible.

But here's what I've learned: **every piece of feedback contains a story**.

## Listening beyond the words

When a client says "make it more dynamic," they're not asking for faster cuts. They're saying something isn't landing emotionally. When they say "it's too long," they're not asking you to cut minutes—they're saying the pacing feels off.

The skill isn't in following instructions literally. It's in hearing what they're really trying to say.

## Finding the thread

I start by asking: What's the core concern? What's the feeling they want? What's the story they're trying to tell?

Once I find that thread, everything else falls into place. The scattered notes start making sense. The contradictions reveal themselves as different ways of saying the same thing.

## The process

1. **Read everything** - Don't skip anything, even if it seems contradictory
2. **Find patterns** - What keeps coming up? What's the underlying concern?
3. **Ask questions** - If something isn't clear, ask. Better to clarify than guess.
4. **Trust the story** - Once you find the thread, trust it. Let it guide your decisions.

## The result

When you find the story inside the feedback, something shifts. The notes stop feeling like obstacles and start feeling like clues. The direction becomes clear. And you can move forward with confidence.

Because every piece of feedback is someone trying to tell you something. Your job is to listen well enough to hear it.
